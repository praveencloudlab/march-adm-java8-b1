Object class
==================
-> Object class is super class to all the classes in java
-> Object class can store/hold any other class objects
	ex: Object obj=new Employee();
		Object obj=new String();
-> contains methods which are common for any class in java
   like folowing
   
   hashCode
   toString
   equals
   compareTo
   getClass
   clone
   ---------
   notify
   notifyAll
   wait
   ---------

   Object : 2 types
   ==================
   1.mutable (content of an object can be modified)
   2.immiutable (content of an object can not be modified)

   hash code?
   ============
   hashcode can be assigned in two ways
   1.simple class objects
   2.complex class objects

   1.simple class objects
   ---------------------------
   -> only one type of content can be stored at at time
   -> uses unicode (i18n) system to assign hashcode
   	Ex: String, Integer, Double etc...
   	Ex: Character ch='A' : hacode can be : 65

   -> hashcode can be customised by overriding hashCode from
      Object classs
   -> this customisation will not change actual hashcode from
      heap memory
