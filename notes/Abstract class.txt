Abstract class
==================
Why we need: We need abstract classes to mandate sub class to override super class
abstract methods. What ever the method you want to override on the subclass mandate,
then that method can be defined as 'abstract' in the super class.

what is abstract class?
=========================
-> Abstract class contains zero or more abstract and concrete methods
-> abstract methods do not have method body. its only method declaration
-> all the sub classes of abstract class must override all the abstract methods
   of an abstract class.
-> if any of sub class of an abstract class is not overriding abstract methods of
   abstract class, then that sub class must be defined as 'abstract'
-> abstarct class object can not be created. but we can create a referance to it.
-> abstract class referance can store all its sub class objects.
-> reference of an abstarct class can be used to access all the methods of
   abstract class and overriden methods of sub class.
-> reference of an abstract class van not be used to access the individual methods
   of sub class
