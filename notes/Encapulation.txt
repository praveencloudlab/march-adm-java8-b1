		POJO class (Plain old java object) / Bean / Model / Entity
		rules
		-----
			-> every property in the class should be 'private'
			-> every method in the class should be 'public' with getters and seters 

			getters :content can not be modified:: getXXX ( where XXX is the name of a variable)
			setters :cantent can be modified :: setXXX ( where XXX is the name of a variable)

			getters will not have arguments, but have return type
			setters will not have return type, nut have arguments

	   1. has 'A' 
	   2. is 'A' 

	   1. has 'A' :: class forward declaration
