Collection API
========================
Collection - Interface
List extends Collection
Set extemds  Collection

List is indexed based data structure
Set is non-indexed based data structure

List interface has following implementation classes
	-> ArrayList
	-> Vectore
	-> Stack
	-> LinkedList

Set interface has following implementation classes
	-> HashSet
	-> LinkedHahsSet
	-> TreeSet

one more independent interface which doesnt implements / extends Collection interface : Map interface

Map interface has following implementation classes
	-> HashMap
	-> Hashtable
	-> LinkedHashMap
	-> TreeMap
note: Map also non indexed based data structute
-> stores the data with key and value pares
	Ex: {mobile_no:109283923}


   
   Generics in Java : Templates in C++
   ===========================================
   -> Type safty
   -> Reusability




   List interface
   ==================
   ArtrayList: 
   1.Its an indexd based 
   2.Insersion order is same
   3.duplicates accepted
   4.its not synchronised

   Set interface
   ===================
   => insertion orer is not same
   => no duplicates
   => non indexed data structure

   Map interface
   ===================
   => with key and value combination
   => key can not be duplicate
   => value can be duplicate

   HashMap:
   	=> key can be null
   	=> value can be null
   	=> insertion order is not same

   Hashtable:
   => Ket can not be null
   => value can not be null
   => synchrized

   LinkedHashMap:
   => everything same like HashSet except insertion order.
   => Insertin order is same
